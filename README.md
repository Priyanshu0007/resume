## Description

Creating a Pig Game website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS involves building an interactive web application where two players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points while avoiding the risk of rolling a '1' and losing their turn. The HTML structure defines the game board, player scores, dice images, and buttons, while CSS is utilized to style the interface, making it visually appealing and responsive. JavaScript handles the game logic, including dice rolling, updating scores, checking for a winner, and implementing the core rules. It also manages player turns and dynamically updates the user interface based on game events. Additionally, sound effects and animations can be incorporated to enhance the gaming experience, making it an engaging and entertaining web-based rendition of the classic Pig Game.
